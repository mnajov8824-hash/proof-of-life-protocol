# Proof of Life Protocol (MVP)

## What is this?
Proof of Life is a practical system that makes keeping animals alive more profitable than slaughtering them.

This is not an ethical campaign.
This is not a vegan movement.
This is an economic protocol.

## The problem
Animals are slaughtered because it is economically rational.
Telling people to change morals does not work.
Changing incentives does.

## The solution
We pay animal owners for verifiable proof that their animals are alive.
As long as the animal is alive, payments continue.
Slaughter permanently stops payments.

## How it works (MVP)
- One animal type (cattle)
- One region
- Monthly proof-of-life video
- Manual validation
- Stablecoin payments (USDC)
- No token, no DAO, no speculation

## Why blockchain?
- Transparent payments
- No hidden rules
- Verifiable history per animal

## Status
MVP – early stage.
