# Protocol Concept

## Goal
Make keeping animals alive economically more attractive than slaughter.

## Core idea
Animal owners receive recurring payments for verifiable proof that their animals remain alive.
Payments stop permanently upon slaughter.

## Proof of Life (MVP)
- Monthly short video of the animal
- Video must include:
  - visible animal
  - current date (spoken or written)
- Manual verification by independent validators

## Economic model
- Owners earn more by keeping animals alive long-term
- Payments are competitive with local slaughter profits
- A small dynamic protocol fee (1–2%) sustains infrastructure and verification

## Fraud prevention
- Random audits
- Validator accountability
- Permanent removal upon confirmed fraud

## Scope limitations
- One animal type
- One region
- No automation
- No token issuance
