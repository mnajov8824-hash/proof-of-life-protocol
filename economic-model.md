# Economic Model

## Goal
Make keeping animals alive more profitable than slaughtering them.

## Participants
- Animal owner
- Donor / sponsor
- Protocol (Proof of Life)

## Payment Flow
- Each verified living animal receives a fixed monthly payment
- Payments stop immediately if proof is not submitted or animal is slaughtered

## Proof Requirement
- Monthly short video
- Animal clearly visible
- Current date shown or spoken
- Manual verification (MVP phase)

## Incentives
- Owners earn predictable income
- Donors directly save animal lives
- Protocol takes small fee (1–2%) for sustainability

## Initial MVP Numbers (example)
- $5–10 per animal per month
- Focus on small farms / villages
