# Proof of Life Protocol — Pitch

## The Problem
Animals are slaughtered not because people want to kill them,
but because keeping them alive is economically irrational.

## The Insight
Change incentives, and behavior follows.

## The Solution
Proof of Life pays animal owners for keeping animals alive,
using verifiable proof and transparent payments.

## How It Works
1. Animal registered
2. Monthly proof submitted
3. Verification
4. Stablecoin payment released
5. Repeat

## Why It Works
- Aligns ethics with economics
- Requires no lifestyle change
- Transparent and verifiable
- Scales globally

## What We Need
- Pilot funding
- NGO partnerships
- Technical collaborators
